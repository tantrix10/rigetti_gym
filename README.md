# Taking Rigetti to the gym
reinforcement learner for the cart pole problem written in pyquil.

Was written as part of QuHackEd, Edinburgh university's quantum machine learning hackathon. 
This was part of the winning project, which is nice. :D

The natural complaint of this work is that it is a classical problem using a classically simulable quantum computer. I did have intentions of making the cart pole some kind of unstable 'top heavy' quantum system, but lacked the time for that. I do have intentions of making it so, as well as improving the general quality of this project, lifting it out of the quagmire of hackathon code. It's an interesting space.
